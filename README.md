# Guessing_Game1

The concept for the final version of this game:
An IED is hidden somewhere in the battlefield  that is displayed below us.  Click the "Display the Grid" button for a grid with numbers from 1 - 100 to be superimposed a cross the image. It should toggle on and off. 
As grid numbers are guessed, that part of the corresponding image  is either blacked off or "exploded".  If the actual IED grid location is hit, there is a larger explosion.
